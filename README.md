# Java-Synchronization-Router-simulator-
We simulate a limited number of devices connected to a routerâ€™s Wi-Fi using Java threading and semaphore. 
Routers can be designed to limit the number of open connections. For example, a Router may wish to have only N connections at any point in time. 
As soon as N connections are made, the Router will not accept other incoming connections until an existing connection is released. 
Explain how semaphores can be used by a Router to limit the number of concurrent connections
